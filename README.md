MusicGenreClassification.ipynb is our jupyter notebook which contains our entire program. It is prepared to be used inside Google Collab as it takes to long to run on a local machine.
MusicGenreClassification.pdf is the report.
custom_features_30_s.csv is the .csv file generated by our notebook.

There is nothing in the Data folder as the data set is too bit but it can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification
